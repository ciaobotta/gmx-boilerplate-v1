## GMX v2 Price Feeds

GMX v2 provides comprehensive price feeds for assets through multiple mechanisms:

### Price Feed Architecture

**Oracle System**: GMX v2 uses Chainlink's low-latency Data Streams - a pull-based oracle model that aggregates token prices from top exchanges. The system includes:
- Oracle keepers that pull prices from reference exchanges and sign the data
- Archive nodes that store signed price information
- Order keepers that bundle signed oracle prices with trade requests

**Price Aggregation**: Mark prices are aggregated from multiple exchanges to reduce liquidation risks from temporary price wicks. The system provides both minimum and maximum prices to include bid-ask spread information.

### Available APIs for Price Data

REST API Endpoints (available on Arbitrum, Avalanche, Botanix):

1. **Real-time Tickers**: `https://{network}-api.gmxinfra.io/prices/tickers`
2. **Signed Prices**: `https://{network}-api.gmxinfra.io/signed_prices/latest`
3. **Historical Candlesticks**: `https://{network}-api.gmxinfra.io/prices/candles`
   - Supports timeframes: 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d
4. **Token List**: `https://{network}-api.gmxinfra.io/tokens`

**Smart Contracts**: GMX v2 contracts expose oracle interfaces for on-chain price access, with prices stored at 30 decimal precision.

The pricing system is designed for high-frequency trading with reduced slippage through the low-latency oracle integration.
